# Practice Linked Lists Part 1

In this three-part exercise, your task is to implement the constructor,
`addToHead` and `addToTail` function for a `LinkedList` and a
`DoublyLinkedList`.

Read the specs for details.

## Instructions

1. Clone the [starter] repo
2. Install all packages by typing `npm install`
3. Read through the test specs to understand the task
4. Run specs with `npm test test/linked-list-practice-specs.js`

## Part 1: Singly Linked List

Start by implementing the most basic linked list that can `addToHead` and
`addToTail`. It should only have a `head` pointer, no `tail` pointer.

Add your code to `linked-list.js`.

Run tests with `npm test test/linked-list-practice-specs.js`

Read test specs for implementation requirements and details.
