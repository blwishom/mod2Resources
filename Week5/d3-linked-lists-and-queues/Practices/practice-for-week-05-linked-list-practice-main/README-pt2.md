# Practice Linked Lists Part 2

In this three-part exercise, your task is to implement the constructor,
`addToHead` and `addToTail` function for a `LinkedList` and a
`DoublyLinkedList`.

Read the specs for details.

## Instructions

1. Continue working in the [starter] repo as part 1
2. Run specs with `npm test test/doubly-linked-list-practice-specs.js`

## Part 2: Doubly Linked List

Next, implement the same `addToHead` and `addToTail` functions in a doubly
linked list. It should have both a `head` and `tail` pointer.

Add your code to `doubly-linked-list.js`.

Run tests with `npm test test/doubly-linked-list-practice-specs.js`

Read test specs for implementation requirements and details.
