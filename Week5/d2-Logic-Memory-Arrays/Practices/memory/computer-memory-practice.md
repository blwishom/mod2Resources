      Computer memory, also known as RAM, is a linear bank of bits (1s and 0s) which store data on your computer. The bits are divided into "words" which are dependent on the chip architecture: For example, a 32-bit processor's words are 32 bits each. Unlike hard drives, memory requires a power source to run. Memory can be accessed in O(1) time.
