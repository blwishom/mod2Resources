Describe memory:

"Computer memory is what stores the computer's state and the state of different parts of your program. Each piece of information in your computer gets stored in binary form in different memory addresses, to be retrieved at a later time.
These memory addresses are stored in RAM on your computer, and can be overwritten as new information states are stored. Each memory address is comprised of various amounts of bytes, which are each 8 bits. Each bit holds an electrical charge that represents either 0 or 1. This is how information is stored physically and follows binary principles" - Jason C

"Computer memory, also known as RAM, is a linear bank of bits (1s and 0s) which store data on your computer. The bits are divided into "words" which are dependent on the chip architecture: For example, a 32-bit processor's words are 32 bits each. Unlike hard drives, memory requires a power source to run. Memory can be accessed in O(1) time." - official answer
