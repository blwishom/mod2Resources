# Unit Testing Practice

# Directions

Clone the starter from here [starter](https://github.com/appacademy-starters 'unit testing practice'). 
Run `npm install` to download dependencies.

1. In the file `funcs.js`, you will find three skeleton functions. Your job is
   to complete those functions according to the specs found in `funcs-spec.js`.
2. In the file `class.js`, you will find a class `Word`. Your job is to
   write the test code in `class-spec.js` to test the constructor, its variables
   and the instance methods found in the `Word` class.

Run `mocha` to confirm your code is written correctly.
