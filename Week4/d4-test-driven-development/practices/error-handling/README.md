# Error practice

In this exercise, you will practice reading, throwing and handling JavaScript
runtime errors.

## Directions

1. Clone the project from the [starter].
2. `Sum` function is throwing an error! Determine why the error is thrown, and handle it using `try...catch` and print the error by using custom `handleError` function
3. Create `sayName(name)` function that will print the name that is passed to it if `name` argument is a string. It should throw a TypeError if `name` is not a string. Run `sayName` function inside of `try...catch` and print out error message if error is thrown.
4. Create a custom `ValidationError` class that extends Error class. Throw a ValidationError with a message.
