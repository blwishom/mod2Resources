# Making Code DRY Practice

Clone the starter from [Github].

## Directions
You will find 4 functions in the file `DRY-code-practice.js`. Your job is to
look at the 4 functions and identify where you may be able to refactor by
creating a helper function to DRY this code up.

When you are sure that you have successfully refactored the code, run
`node DRY-code-practice.js` to see if the functions still return the correct
information.
