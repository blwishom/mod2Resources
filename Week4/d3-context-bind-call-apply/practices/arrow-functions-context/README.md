# Context practice with Arrow functions

In this practice, you will be debugging a context bug by using a fat arrow
function in a class constructor.

## Directions

1. Clone the project from the [starter]
2. Run the code with `node starter.js`
3. Debug the error by creating an arrow function in the `constructor` of the
   `User` class
4. The code should return the string, _"Hi my name is Elle"_
