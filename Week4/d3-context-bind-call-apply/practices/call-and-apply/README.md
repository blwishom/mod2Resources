# Call and Apply Practice

In this exercise, you will be debugging code that has lost context.

## Directions

1. Clone the [starter]
2. Run the greeting with `node greet.js`
3. Run the gradebook with `node grade.js`
4. Debug the code in each to match the directions

### Greet

Without modifying the `say` function, can you get the greetings to print out
correctly? The code should print out the following from `node greet.js`.

```plaintext
Hello, John!
Hey there, Michael!
```

### Grades

Without modifying `GradeBook`, `grades` or `gradesAvg`, can you correctly
print out the grades average with and without a 20 point bonus? A correct
function will return the following from `node grade.js`

```plaintext
Grade list
58
78
```
