/*
Selection sort works very similar to Bubble Sort, but it works on sending the
smallest elements down to the beginning of the array instead of sending the
largest elements up. For the same reasons as Bubble Sort, Selection Sort is not
very efficient at all.

The algorithm can be summarized as follows:
1. Set MIN to location 0.
2. Search the minimum element in the list.
3. Swap with value at location MIN
4. Increment MIN to point to next element
5. Repeat until list is sorted
