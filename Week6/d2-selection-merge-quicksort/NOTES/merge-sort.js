/*
Merge sort is the first of the efficient algorithms you will learn. 

Merge sort operates with a much better ime complexity (which we will learn about
tomorrow) than the more naive approaches we started with.

The main ideas of merge sort are:
1. It is easy to merge elements of two sorted arrays into a single sorted array
2. You can consider an array containing only a single element as already sorted
3. You can also consider an empty array as sorted
